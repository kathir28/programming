# H20_project1_kathiras_tobiasld
Project 1 for kathiras (kathiras@mail.uio.no) and tobiasld (tobiasld@mail.uio.no)
We tried using hassatr in properties to check if solve has been called. This failed, so we used a boolen check test instead. We have commented out the hasattr incase if you want to read it. \\
One test failed, test_prop in test_pendulum, because of the has_been_called statement didn't work. We didn't have the time to troubleshoot this any further \\
We didn't find the mp4 video in the files, we dont know why
